Simple C# captcha using web services and ajax

This is just a fun project I have done on a weekend over a glass of wine. All I wanted to do is a simple captcha generator and may be in the future I can refactor my code and add more feature to it.

Because I am using canvas tag, this won't on IE7 and IE8. 
who still using IE any way? :)
